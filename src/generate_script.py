def generate_script(demonstrations: list[dict]) -> str:
    """
    :args:
        demonstrations: a list of demonstration data, each containing user actions
            (clicks, typing, scrolling) and the textual descriptions of these actions.

    :desc:
        This function consumes demonstration data and produces a Python Playwright script
        in string form. The script will replicate the same sequence of actions the user
        performed, dynamically handling the changing DOM after each interaction.

        Core Logic (Pseudo Code, Not Actual Python):
        1. Initialize an empty sequence of 'script steps'.
        2. For each demonstration in 'demonstrations':
            a. Decompose it into step-by-step user actions (e.g., "click item X", "type this text").
            b. For each action:
                i. Obtain the latest page DOM at this moment (in an actual implementation, we need to simulate the steps in real-time).
                ii. Provide the DOM plus the user instruction to an LLM-based 
                    mechanism that locates the relevant element or approach (for example, a
                    selector like "button:has-text('Close')").
                iii. Append a line of pseudo-script to 'script steps' corresponding to the
                    identified action (for example, "page.click('button.close-modal')").
                iv. Include any waiting logic if needed (like waiting for the modal to appear
                    before clicking).
                v. After the action is performed (in practice), capture or assume the new DOM
                    state for subsequent steps.
        3. Once all actions are processed, wrap 'script steps' with standard boilerplate for
            opening a browser, creating a page, and closing the browser.
        4. Convert this sequence of steps into a final string that represents the entire
            Playwright script.

    :returns:
        A string that (in a real system) would be a valid Python script using Playwright to
        replicate the user's demonstrated actions, including logic to adapt to DOM changes
        after each step.

    # 1) Parse demonstrations into step-by-step instructions
    # 2) For each action, figure out how to locate the necessary element in the current DOM
    # 3) Generate lines of "click", "fill", "scroll", or "wait" instructions
    # 4) Re-check or re-fetch DOM changes after each action
    # 5) Accumulate all lines into a script that can be returned as text
